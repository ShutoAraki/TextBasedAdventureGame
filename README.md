<b>Disclaimer</b>
This is back when Shuto didn't know a lot about git and documentation. He just learned OOP and did his best with his partner Salman Haider, who also didn't really know much about OOP. Shuto decided to leave this repo undocumented intentionally so that he can look back at this repo/code some day and motivate himself by thinking how bad he was back when he was a sophomore in college to confirm how far his technical sophistication have matured. Please just enjoy his progress as he goes through his undergraduate as a CS major at DePauw.
